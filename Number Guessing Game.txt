Number Guessing Game

Develop a number guessing game where the
computer randomly selects a number, and the
player has to guess it. Provide hints like "too high"
or "too low" to help the player guess the correct
number

Program

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
int main() {
    std::srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(std::time(0))); 
    int numberToGuess = std::rand() % 100 + 1; 
    int playerGuess = 0;
    std::cout << "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Try to guess it!" << std::endl;
    while (playerGuess != numberToGuess) {
        std::cout << "Enter your guess: ";
        std::cin >> playerGuess;
        if (playerGuess > numberToGuess) {
            std::cout << "Too high! Try again." << std::endl;
        } else if (playerGuess < numberToGuess) {
            std::cout << "Too low! Try again." << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Congratulations! You've guessed the number!" << std::endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
